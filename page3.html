				<h2>Be Prepared</h2>		
				<time datetime="5-1-17">May 2017</time>
				
				<p>
				What a wondrous time is spring when all the trees are budding, the birds begin to sing, the flowers start their blooming. Most of us sang the song Pass it On at some time in our lives. There is so much of our God's creation we enjoy watching come back to life in the spring. We can be so grateful for these wonders. At this time we enjoy beautiful weather but we know there can be naturals disasters that occur. It is getting close to tornado season. How prepared are you? You may have your plan for where to go in a tornado and how to handle power outages but what about afterwards. The CDC has some suggestions of what to do post event.
				</p>
				<p>
				We know about physical hazards as in shattered glass and displaced objects but remember the clean up can cause overexertion. Pace yourself. Animals may have been injured or their shelter disturbed so we need to watch out for them, too. Do you have some canned food and bottled water? Food and first aid for your pets?
				</p>
				<p>
				Chemical hazards need to be anticipated like gas leaks, contamination of food and water or even the environment. Do you know how to shelter in place? Do you have the ability to secure your place of shelter?
				</p>
				<p>
				Disease hazards may occur like sewage exposure and issues with crowded living conditions if you need to go to a shelter. Effective handwashing is the number one way we can prevent the spread of disease. Do you have gloves on hand as a barrier to exposure?
				</p>
				<p>
				Psychological hazards like post traumatic stress anxiety, fear, depression can occur after disasters so we need to be aware of good ways to handle stress and encourage people to find healthy ways to cope. Good coping mechanisms include the use of music, physical movement like going for a walk to exercise, gettting enough rest and spending time talking to friends and family. We know that we have a God who cares for use all so we can always go to Him in prayer. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Be prepared for whatever the year brings. We hope we don't have to deal with anything negative and we can just enjoy God's creation in all it's splendor.

				<h2>Hope</h2>		
				<time datetime="4-1-17">April 2017</time>
				
				<p>
				The Easter reason is one of celebration. We had learned a lot in our Lenten journey about the people of God and how we can relate to Him in our own way. We go forward knowing that we have great hope of our salvation through what Christ did in being the perfect sacrifice for redemption. What a gift! What hope we have for our time of living with the Triune God as one of His own in the pace He has prepared for us.
				</p>
				<p>
				Hope can be used as a noun as in aspiration, expectations, goals, plans, ambitions. It is also used as a verb. When we want something to happen or we want something to be the case, we say things like I hope you have a good day. I hope all is well.
				</p>
				<p>
				Hope gives us strength to face situations that are difficult in our lives. We read, study and listen to God's word to help us through this life. As God is the source of our strength we know we are on solid ground. When there is shifting sand we need to go back to the rock and stand there confidently knowing where our strength lies. We also know that God's timing is not ours. When Abraham was told his descendants would be as many as the stars how hard that would have been for Abraham to trust God to sacrifice his son. It is hard to imagine we wouldn't think of all kinds of reasons why we wouldn't comply. God had a plan. God's way is not our way. With our limited understanding we need to thank God in all circumstances.
				</p>
				<p>
				We need to live in His will. We follow what we know but we need to be open to new ideas, too. Remember when we heard nutrition advice that ended up being wrong. Avoid butter so use margarine. Avoid eggs. We know better now but there are always cycles of advice so we need to weigh the facts and use credible sources. We are fortunate that we have access to fresh fruits and vegatables all year long. The antioxidants in produce helps our bodies function better and we need the fiber and different nutrients in different colored produce. Gardening is a healthy activity most people can enjoy. If that is not something you like or don't have access to a garden space, we are fortunate to have CSAs. Enjoy eating colorfully.
				</p>
				<p>
				Wellness is the goal of the ROSE Group. We hope all of you enjoy the many gifts you have been given. We hope you trust God to lead you each day. We hope you live with a spirit of gratitude.
				</p>
				<p>
				In Love, Marsha Hendrickson

				<h2>Be Kind to your Body</h2>		
				<time datetime="1-1-17">January 2017</time>
				
				<p>
				Happy New Year!
				</p>
				<p>
				So traditionally we have resolutions and goals for a fresh start in the new year. An ideal weight is often one of those goals. Some feel they have eaten more than they should have and have gained weight over the holidays. It tends to make people spiral out of control in their eating if they feel like they have already blown it or don't have self control.
				</p>
				<p>
				Food is not good and bad. Some foods are just better for your body. Bodies need fuel (energy and repair) and we know that just like fuel for our vehicles not all made so every kind of fuel can be used in all vehicles, so food that is nutrient dense is better than empty calories. We are not perfect in managing our food habits but we can be kinder in the way we treat ourselves when we fail to eat right. Everything in moderation, right.
				</p>
				<p>
				We might wish our stomachs had a fuel guage to let us know when we are running on low or full but while we had the ability to know when to stop as a child, that ability has become blunted as we ignore it, confuse it or forget it. Are you just thirsty? Tired? Bored? To practice better control and less mindless eating it is helpful to stop before we eat to see how hungry we are, reevaluate when you are half done and when we have finished. Don't beat yourself up or let others control how you think about yourself. Take time and enjoy your food, just choose wisely.
